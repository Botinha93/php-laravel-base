Provides base classes to greatly increase the development speed and final product deliver on laravel projects.

The basic idea is that instead of focusing on repetitive tasks, like creating all basic post, get, delete, update, etc that every entity has to have, data validation, data access, permissioning for endpoints, advanced search, etc. The developer is now able to focus only the specific business logic for each entity, as generic and functional ways of parametrizing entities was provided for every possible entity task through simpler parametrization.
